<h1>Tim Persona</h1>
<img src="https://i.pinimg.com/474x/fe/5e/a9/fe5ea92eb8dfbdadac55c02db21f18b7.jpg" alt="Tim">
<p><b>Name:</b> Tim</p>
<p><b>Gender:</b> Male</p>
<p><b>Age:</b> 7</p>
<p><b>Location:</b> Albuquerque, New Mexico</p>

<p><b><u>Technology:</u></b></p>
<p><b>Devices:</b> iPad</p>
<p>Tim uses his iPad constantly, he knows how to use it.</p>

<p><b><u>Attitude & Needs:</u></b></p>
<p>Tim uses his iPad, but forgets that he has chores to do. He uses Kidtasktic to see the chores he needs to do, and the
	tasks he needs to complete. He reads through the steps to see how to do them. He earns rewards after he completes all
	of them in a day, like an extra hour before bedtime. His mom rewards him by giving him Ice Cream when he doesn't forget
	to do his chores for a whole week. If he forgets to do one chore or a task, he doesn't get Ice Cream. If he forgets
	multiple or all, his mom punishes him by taking away his iPad for two days. Kidtasktic makes it easier for the mom
	and Tim, because the mom can add chores to the site, and Tim will see it on his iPad, and he goes through the steps
	for that chore or task. This way, Tim doesn't have to wonder how to do a task or chore, and he gets rewards!</p>

<p><b><u>Frustrations</u></b></p>
<ul>
	<li>Tim does not like when mom adds too many chores.</li>
	<li>Tim does not like when mom limits his screen time.</li>
</ul>
