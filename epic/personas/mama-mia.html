<h2>Situation</h2>
<p>Mamma Mia has had an extremely busy day. She comes home and it's already time for dinner. Her kid was bugging to turn on the tv.
	Mia declared, "If your room is clean, clothes are put away, and homework is doneâ€”yes, you may watch TV." </p>
<p>Mia goes back to making dinner as she hears the tv blaring in the next room. She steps into the next room as she passes her kids bedroom.
Her eye catches the clothes that were supposed to be put away, still on the bed.</p>
<p>If only there was an easier way to keep track of the list of tasks she gives her child to ensure she is raising a responsible individual.</p>
